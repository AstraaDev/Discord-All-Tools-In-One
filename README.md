## Errors/Fixes

pyinstaller is not recognized as an external command
> open a cmd and type `pip install pyinstaller` or make sure [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is added to [PATH](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/)

> You probably have python 3.10 which has some new shit so downgrade to [python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/)
